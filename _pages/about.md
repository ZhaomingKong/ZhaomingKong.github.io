I am currently living with my parents and applying for a PhD at SCUT, Guangzhou. My research interest lies in tensor analysis, image restoration and explanable deep learning. I received the B.S. in applied mathematics and M.Sc. in software engineering from SCUT in 2016 and 2019, respectively. I enjoy studying English and I am a part-time translator. Now my priority is to try to lose some weight.

Denoising Comparison Project
======
In this project, we extensively compare numerous on both synthetic and real-world datasets. We also work hard to collect new color image and video datasets for benchmarking, and our evaluations are performed from different perspectives. We will continuously update our datasets and denoising results of compared methods on this page.
