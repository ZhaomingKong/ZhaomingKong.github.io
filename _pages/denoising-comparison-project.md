I am currently living with my parents and applying for a PhD at SCUT, Guangzhou. My research interest lies in tensor analysis, image restoration and explanable deep learning. I received the B.S. in applied mathematics and M.Sc. in software engineering from SCUT in 2016 and 2019, respectively. I enjoy studying English and I am a part-time translator. Now my priority is to try to lose some weight.
